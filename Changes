Revision history for Mock-Sub

1.01    2015-xxxxxx
        - DESTROY() always calls unmock() now. The option to disable this has
          been removed

0.11    2015-12-08
        - if mock() is called in void context, we'll croak (except in the
          instance where you're re-mocking an unmock()ed sub with the same
          object)
        - fixes bug where DESTROY() wasn't able to properly clean up prior
          to END

0.10    2015-12-07
        - all bugs fixed in this release reported by Joel Berger (jberger)
        - fix issue #5: we now pass in any parameters passed to the mocked
          function into the side_effect cref
        - fix issue #6: return_value() now accepts lists (however, using the
          param version of return_value, only a scalar is accepted).
        - fix issue #8: called_with() now die()s if it's called before the
          mocked sub has been
        - fix issue #7: mocked sub (and the object) is now much more context
          aware
        - fix issue #9: DESTROY() now unmock()s by default
          (keep_mock_on_destroy param to override)

        - mocking a non-existent sub is now allowed, and spits out a warning
          message
        - unmock() removes the symtab entry if mock() created a fake
          (non-existent) sub entry in the symbol table
        - added side_effect() and return_value()

          the mocked sub
        - fixes bug #4: completely validate that the sub param is a valid sub
        - 'main::' is now prepended to subs if they don't have a package
